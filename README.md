# Planet Simulation in Pygame

This Python project, titled "Planet Simulation," uses the Pygame library to create a visually engaging simulation of the motion of planets in our solar system. The simulation includes the Sun and four planets: Earth, Mars, Mercury, and Venus. Each planet is represented by a colored circle that moves according to its gravitational interactions with the other celestial bodies. Here's a brief overview of the project and how to run it:

## Project Overview

### Features
- Realistic gravitational physics simulation.
- Interactive Pygame window displaying the planets' movements.
- Orbits drawn to visualize the planets' paths.
- Display of the distance from each planet to the Sun.
- Color-coded planets for easy identification.

### Planets
1. **Sun**: The central star of the solar system.
2. **Earth**: Represented by a blue circle.
3. **Mars**: Represented by a red circle.
4. **Mercury**: Represented by a dark grey circle.
5. **Venus**: Represented by a white circle.

### Controls
- Close the simulation window to exit the program.

## How to Run

1. Ensure you have Python and the Pygame library installed on your computer.

2. Copy and paste the provided code into a Python file, e.g., `planet_simulation.py`.

3. Save the file and run it using your preferred Python interpreter.

4. The Pygame window will open, displaying the planets' motion and orbits.

5. To exit the simulation, simply close the window.

## Customization

You can customize the simulation by modifying the parameters of the planets, such as their initial positions, radii, velocities, and masses. You can also change the colors of the planets by modifying the `YELLOW`, `BLUE`, `RED`, `DARK_GREY`, and `WHITE` constants in the code.

Feel free to experiment with different planet properties and configurations to create your own unique planetary simulations.

## Dependencies

- Python (3.x recommended)
- Pygame library
